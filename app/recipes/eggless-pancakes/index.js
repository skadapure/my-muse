  title: 'Eggless-Pancakes',
  shortDescription: 'Pancakes are undoubtedly one of the most liked breakfast. Kids have  special craving for these. I have always wanted to try those but unfortunately those traditionally have eggs in them. I finally decided to give it a try to make them with out eggs. After multiple attempts I came out with a recipe. I hope you guys give this a try.',

  details: 'The prep work for pancakes is simple and should take you about 10-15 minutes. There is no real egg substitute for this but I did use a pinch of baking soda to make it fluffier. The pan should not be over-heated or else the pancakes will blacken. To get that nice golden color I usually keep the knob at 4. You can add a couple of blueberries to the batter. You can add about 1/2 a cup of nuts, fruits or chocolate chips for this measurement.',
  ingredients: ['1 Cup All Purpose Flour', '1 Tablespoon Sugar', '1 Teaspoons Baking Powder', '1/4 Teaspoon Baking Soda', '1 Pich Salt', '1/2 Cup Milk ', '1/2 Cup Water', '2 Tablespoon Vegetable Oil/ Butter', '1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract'],
  steps: ['Stir together the dry ingredients', 'In a liquid measuring mug, measure 1/2 cup milk. To that add the vegetable oil, water and vanilla extract.', 'Stir in the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Do not over-mix. Lumps are perfectly fine. Set aside for a couple of minutes.', 'Heat a griddle at medium-high heat.', 'When the pan is hot enough, pour a ladleful of batter on the pan for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the face of the pancake.', 'Carefully flip the pancake and cook until its golden brown.'],
  taste: 'Light, soft and fluffy! You have to add some maplesyrup or something to sweeten it because its not sweet by itself. But I guess thatâ€™s how pancakes are supposed to be.',
