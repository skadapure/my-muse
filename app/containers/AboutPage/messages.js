I myself being a person who never eats eggs would always be disappointed at the bakery only to find out the limited to no options of cakes, pastries or ice creams without eggs. I strongly believe in not limiting our selves because of the restrictions we have. So I decided to come up with a site with recipes for eggless food which are other wise made with eggs. I hope you guys leave this site with some lessons on making some eggless food.',
